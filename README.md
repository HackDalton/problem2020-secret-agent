# HackDalton: Secret Agent

## Problem:

Agent, the fate of the world rests on you. Terrorists have taken control of a nuclear arsenal and now have control of a stockpile of nuclear weapons. They have locked themselves in the arsenal with a password, and when entered wrong or broken into, the nuclear missiles will automatically be launched and strike capital cities around the world. The terrorists are communicating the password between each other using [this](./nhb.out.png) image. The world is doomed unless you can crack the code, special agent.

## Hints
1. Look into least-significant-bit encoding.
